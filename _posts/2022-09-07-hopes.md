title: What I hope to get from 6.1040 this semester
---

I've been designing and developing little websites ever since I picked up HTML and CSS through trial and error while making Tumblr themes as a pre-teen. However, when I learned the basics of web development, I didn't know any programming or computer science concepts. Now that I have classes in software design and data structures under my belt, I want to explicitly connect those realms of knowledge.

Additionally, much of the early web development work I did was on my own, so it's particularly gratifying to study and practice this work with others. Whether we're coming up with ideas, learning topics together, or giving and receiving feedback, I'm looking forward to being in intellectual community.

Other aspirations:

- I like artifact-driven (or maybe just artifact-generating) learning and am excited to put together a portfolio of creations and contributions that I can consider finished.
- I want to acquire more mental models and frameworks for design.
- I have a c h o n k y courseload this semester since I switched majors late and have many requirements to finish up, so I hope to channel this into a productive forcing function to plan out my work, practice time and project management, and stay on top of things ðŸ˜¤

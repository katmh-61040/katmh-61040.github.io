Hi! I'm [Kat](https://katmh.com), a senior studying 6-3. When I was 11, I embarked on a three-year-long journey to self-study Modern Greek. The results are not very impressive, but I can read the alphabet and the signs inside Souvla (it's like Saloniki but in San Francisco and more palatable to my non-Mediterranean tastes). I learned how to ride a bike as a junior in college (shout out to Bluebikes and the Westgate parking lot). My [most popular tweet](https://twitter.com/katmhuang/status/1353040170384314368) has 113.1k likes. I enjoy the auto-layout feature in Figma, and I've never had chewing gum before.

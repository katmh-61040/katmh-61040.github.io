# kat takes 6.1040

this is my portfolio for mit's [6.1040 (formerly 6.170) software studio](https://61040-fa22.github.io/), fall 2022.

the site uses a jekyll theme which i made several years ago: "[Point Theme](https://github.com/katmh/point-theme)... a Jekyll theme for personal websites that are simple and to the point."

unfortunately i have not published that theme as a fancy ðŸ’Ž ruby gem ðŸ’Ž or anything, so i "installed" the theme by forking my theme repo ðŸ’€

## releases

i sort of plan to use releases (a github feature that builds on the tags feature of git) to mark states of my repo associated with assignment submissions for ease of reference and organization

## how to run this website locally if you want to do that for some reason

```
git clone https://github.com/katmh-61040/katmh-61040.github.io

cd katmh-61040/katmh-61040.github.io

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

it will materialize on [localhost:4000](localhost:4000) âœ¨
